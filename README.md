# userRegistrationAndLoginDemo
User login and registration demo made to learn the principles in order to implement in other projects.

Fully functional package, containing user db handling, registration, email confirmation and login, to be setup with custom endpoints.
As the connection to external mailing server was out of scope for this project, configuration requires dockerizing MailDev server at port 1025 to catch all sent emails.
